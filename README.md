The Missing Semester of Your CS Education

## Things they do not teach you in schools:
1. Shell Tools and Scripting
2. Editors (Vim)
3. Data Wrangling
4. Command Line Env
5. Version Control (git)
6. Debugging and Profiling
7. Metaprogramming
8. Security and Crypto
9. Potpourri

I will try to make this as succinct as possible with important commands you can refer to if needed. 
Happy Hacking...
